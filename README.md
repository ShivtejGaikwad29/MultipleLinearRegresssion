# MultipleLinearRegresssion
Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between one dependent variable and two or more independent variables. The goal of MLR is to understand how the dependent variable changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.

Key Concepts:
:- Dependent Variable (Y): The outcome or the variable we are trying to predict or explain.
:- Independent Variables (X1, X2, …, Xn): The predictors or factors that influence the dependent variable.
:- Regression Coefficients (β0, β1, …, βn): These coefficients represent the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable.

Formula:
The general form of the multiple linear regression equation is:
Y=β0​+β1​X1​+β2​X2​+...+βn​Xn​+ε

Where:
( Y ) is the predicted value of the dependent variable.
( β_0 ) is the intercept.
( β_1, β_2, …, β_n ) are the coefficients for each independent variable.
( X_1, X_2, …, X_n ) are the independent variables.
( ε ) is the error term, representing the difference between the observed and predicted values.

# MultipleLinearRegresssion
Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between one dependent variable and two or more independent variables. The goal of MLR is to understand how the dependent variable changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.
